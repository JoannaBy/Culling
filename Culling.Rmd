## Disclaimer
The presentation was first created for the participants of DHSI 2018 'Stylometry with R' course.

## What question lies ahead?
As we already know the ins and outs of stylometry with most frequent words, we know that we need to create a table of frequencies of words that will allow for measuring similarities between the texts.  
  
*But should we consider ALL words in the corpus?*

## What makes up a wordlist?
![title](img/wordcloud2.png){width=700px}

## What words are in the corpus?
* a sample corpus of 5 books = 394827 tokens
* a sample corpus of 5 books = 20774 types
  
word token = any word element in the text
word type = distinct word form
e.g. "A cat and a dog sit next to a tree"
here:    
* types: {a, cat, and, dog, sit, next, to, tree}  
* tokens: {a, cat, and, a, dog, sit, next, to, a, tree}

## Which are important?

* All words distributed by frequency*

## Distribution of some words

## Culling
*Excluding from the frequency table the variables (e.g. words, n-Grams) that are characteristic only for some samples*

## Culling in stylo(metry)

*Culling* refers to the *automatic manipulation of the wordlist* (proposed by Hoover 2004a, 2004b).    
The culling values specify the degree to which words that do not appear in all the texts of a corpus will be removed. A culling value of 20 indicates that words that appear in at least 20% of the texts in the corpus will be considered in the analysis. A culling setting of 0 means that no words will be removed; a culling setting of 100 means that only those words will be used in the analysis that appear in all texts of the corpus at least once.

Only the words that appear in ALL of the texts will be included in the wordlist. This excludes *Darcy*, *ship*, *cat* and *ghost*.

## Applications:
* easy way to exclude proper names - as they are characteristic only to the texts they appear in
* way to even out impact of some features of subgenres and of topic.

## Dos and don'ts
*DO:*  
* Remember: the higher the culling, the fewer MFW on your list.  
* Carefully think what % of culling will be useful   
  * usually 20-50% is fine for excluding single works' noise,   
  * higher values should be applied for very specific uses.  
* Compare results with and without culling.
